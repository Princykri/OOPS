/*
Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time, rather than
compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
Letâ€™s begin by restating an important principle: a superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object.
When an overridden method is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to
execute based upon the type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is
made at run time.
In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable)
that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.
